## WARNING

DO NOT USE PORTAINER, it is known to not work and typically breaks things... From the various discussions In the Arr communities and on Linuxserver.io, people generally advise to avoid it... If you're using portainer and this doesn't function as expected, the problem is most likely your installation.... (Example: <https://github.com/RandomNinjaAtk/arr-scripts/discussions/57>)

Also see: <https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#portainer>

## Support Info

Scripts are provided as-is... Generally, if a script works one time, it will work every time - that is the nature of scripts - so if you're experiencing an issue that has not been previously reported and is more likely a technical problem of some sort, it is more than likely caused by user error...
